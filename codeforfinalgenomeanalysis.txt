# Downloaded my genome files and saved them in a folder called 
finalgenomeanalysis on my desktop. 

# Created an environment in conda for my finalgenomeanalysis:
conda create -n finalgenomeanalysis -c bioconda -c conda-forge abyss quast 
dfast fastani spades=4.1.0 

# Activated my environment:
conda activate finalgenomeanalysis

# Located my folder in Terminal:
pwd
cd /Users/ciarablanco/Desktop/finalgenomeanalysis

# Ran SPAdes version 4.1.0
spades.py -1 SRR33049458_1.fastq.gz -2 SRR33049458_2.fastq.gz -o spadesout

# Ran ABySS 2.3.7
abyss-pe name=assembly k=96 B=2G in='SRR33049458_1.fastq.gz 
SRR33049458_2.fastq.gz'

# De-cluttered ABySS results:
mkdir abyssout 
mv assembly* abyssout/ 

# Note: I am interested in the assembly-scaffolds.fa and 
assembly-stats.csv files from by ABySS output.

# Checked the quality of SPAdes assembly using QUAST v5.3.0
quast.py spadesout/scaffolds.fasta -o quastspades 

# Checked the quality of ABySS assembly using QUAST
quast.py abyssout/assembly-scaffolds.fa -o quastabyss 

# Looked at both QUAST report.txt files and determined that the SPAdes 
assembly was the best fit.

# Downloaded eight related genomes: altanticus, diazotrophicus, 
penaeicids, ponticus, rumoiensis, tasmaniensis, tritonius, and vulnificus 
and saved the GCF files as .fasta files

# Created neighbors.txt file with my related genome files

# Ran fastANI v1.34 to identify average nucleotide identity between my 
assembled genome and the three related genomes I downloaded:
fastANI -q spadesout/scaffolds.fasta --rl neighbors.txt -o 
vibrioneighbors.txt
